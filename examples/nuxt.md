# Nuxt 3

You have an example in the [@vite-pwa/nuxt integration repo](https://github.com/vite-pwa/nuxt/tree/main/playground).

::: info WIP
You can also check [Elk repo](https://github.com/elk-zone/elk) for a real world example: we're working to update the repo.

Elk repo is using `Push Notifications` and `Web Share Target API` PWA capabilities and `Prompt for update` register type via `injectManifest` strategy.
